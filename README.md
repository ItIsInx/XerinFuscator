# Xerinfuscator — Next-Gen .NET Obfuscator

**Xerinfuscator** is a powerful next-generation .NET obfuscator that delivers advanced layers of protection to make reverse engineering nearly impossible. It combines multiple techniques — from string and integer encryption to virtualization, anti-debugging, and proxy protection — to ensure the strongest defense for your assemblies.

---

## Key Features

### Code Encryption

Encrypts critical code sections and decrypts them only at runtime, ensuring that your logic remains secure even if the assembly is analyzed.

### Integer Protection

Protects numeric constants with optimized XOR-based encryption algorithms to prevent static value analysis.

### Anti-Decompiling

Prevents source code decompilation using advanced anti-IL and metadata protection layers.

### Anti-Debugging

Detects and prevents runtime debugging attempts, terminating execution when debuggers are attached.

### Anti-Dumping

Blocks memory extraction and dumping of protected assemblies to stop runtime code theft.

### Resources Encryption

Encrypts embedded resources (such as images, files, and configurations) and decrypts them securely at runtime.

### Imports Protection

Protects and hides imported functions and API calls from being easily identified in disassemblers.

### Enum Protection

Encrypts and scrambles enum values to prevent logical inference and analysis of your application’s control paths.

### Constants Mover

Moves and dynamically restores constants to make pattern-based deobfuscation harder.

### Delegate Reference Proxy

Replaces direct calls with indirect delegate proxies, complicating call flow tracing.

### Anti-Tamper

Guards assemblies from modification by adding runtime integrity verification layers.

### Code Virtualization

Converts IL instructions into custom virtual opcodes executed by a secure virtual machine, hiding program logic.

### Control Flow Obfuscation

Rewrites method bodies with complex branching logic, preserving behavior while destroying readability.

### Symbols Renaming

Renames classes, methods, and fields to unreadable names (including Unicode and glyph symbols) to hide structure and meaning.

### Native Packer

Wraps assemblies in a native executable container to compress and hide .NET metadata.

---

## Limitations & Notes

### Limited Packer Support

Native wrapping (native packer) is only available for **.NET Framework executable** assemblies.

### Limited VM Support

Code Virtualization (VM) is only available for **.NET Framework executable** assemblies.

---

## Compatibility

* **Platforms:** Windows.
* **Frameworks:** Xerinfuscator provides comprehensive support for all major .NET platforms including .NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET 5/6/7/8/9/10, ASP.NET, WPF, Xamarin, Mono, and more. Xerinfuscator seamlessly integrates with your development workflow.
* **Application Types:** Console apps, WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET apps, class libraries, services — subject to the limitations above.

## Changelog Highlights

## What's New in v6.1.0

### 🕸️ Reference Proxy
• Bound dynamic wrapper to `module` instead of `type` so it can legally call `non-public` methods inside the same assembly  
• Unified delegate creation: always builds a `DynamicMethod` wrapper, with a fast path using `Delegate.CreateDelegate` only for public static methods when safe  
• Fixed parameter `mapping` for `static` targets  
• Generated proxies now have `straight-line` IL with no stack manipulation beyond the original call, reducing `IL stack` analysis issues on methods like the `ArchiveFactory.OpenArchive` wrapper

### 🧬 Code Virtualization
• Added special handling in `Invoke Call` to detect calls to `System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()`  
• Fixed resource-loading scenarios (e.g. `GetManifestResourceStream("")`) inside virtualized `methods / constructors`
